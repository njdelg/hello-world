This repository is a test, mainly for the purpose of making a repository and being familiar with GitHub and its functions.

Hi, people!
My name is Jonah, and as mentioned, I am just testing the capabilities that this site has in terms of making it user-friendly for coders like me (who is beginning to start liking code; before I hated it to the core, LOL). But right now, I'm diving deep into the realm of Python and all its related scripting languages such as Node.js, Django Framework, etc. 

I like my girl, Tricia, who is my rock and that she gives me the utmost support in everything that I do. I also love my family and friends, and more importantly, CARS.
